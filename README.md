- **H2 Database** - in-memory database for storing temporary data during testing.
- **SQL** - for creating database queries.
- **Liquibase** - for managing database migrations.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - to create the user interface.
- **Thymeleaf** - template engine for dynamically generating HTML pages on the backend.

## TO DO:
- [ ] Write 50 tests (currently: 27/50)
